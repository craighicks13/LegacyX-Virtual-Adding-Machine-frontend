# My Simple Ledger

## Objective

The goal of this challenge is to help us learn how you break down and solve technical challenges. This challenge involves a simple user story, a git repository and you. Read the story and implement the full stack challenge as you see fit. This story is about writing a Virtual Adding Machine to support Harold the accountant - exponentially improving his day to day work.

## User Story

As an accountant, Harold needs to add a number of journal entries and review the history of the calculations for errors. He starts the LegacyX Virtual Adding Machine site and clears the history. Looking at his stack of paper receipts, he begins adding the values until the addition is complete.

While comparing the final results, catastrophe strikes and the power in Harold’s office goes out. When the power is restored, Harold returns to the Virtual Adding Machine site and lets out a cheer when he sees that his work was preserved.

Continuing the review of the results, Harold notices that his calculated balance doesn’t match what he expects, so he begins reviewing the calculation history until he notices an entry that is off by one dollar - a typo! He saves the history to a file, repeats the calculations and the balances match perfectly.

## Instructions

This challenge is your chance to show us what you’ve got, it’s your time to shine! Create a new project in a new git repository. Show us some full stack code. Choose and define the tech and stub in the required methods - explaining the what, why and how within the stubbed out code. We obviously won’t reject a fully functional proof of concept, but the goal here is to help us understand your process.
